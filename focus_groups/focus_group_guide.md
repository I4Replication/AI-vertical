# AI Replication Games — Post-Pilot Focus Group Guide

_Last updated: 2025-xx-xx (update when deployed)_

## Session Logistics
- **Timing**: 60 minutes. Start on time; reserve the final 5 minutes for wrap-up and next steps.
- **Group composition**: Five parallel groups of six participants. Run separate sessions for the AI-assisted arm and the human-only arm to encourage candid discussion; within each arm, cluster participants by inside vs. outside-discipline assignments when possible.
- **Moderators**: I4R qualitative research staff. A note-taker (or co-moderator) should capture non-verbal cues and flag follow-up questions.
- **Confidentiality reminder**: Emphasize that insights inform protocol refinement and should not be shared with future participants until public results are released.
- **Recording**: Obtain explicit consent to record (audio only). Test equipment before participants join.

## Opening Script (5 minutes)
1. Welcome participants and introduce moderators.
2. Confirm consent, explain confidentiality, and note that there are no right or wrong answers.
3. Provide a brief agenda: motivations, preparation, event experience (including AI access or workarounds), cross-discipline reflections, and suggestions.
4. Quick round-robin introduction: name, current role, discipline, prior replication experience (one sentence each).

## Section A — Motivation & Baseline Context (10 minutes)
- **Q1**: What motivated you to sign up for the pilot of the AI Replication Games?
  - *Prompts*: Skill-building, curiosity about AI, institutional incentives, community, mentorship.
- **Q2**: Before the Games, how familiar were you with replication or reproducibility work?
  - *Prompts*: Prior replications, code review, coursework, teaching responsibilities.
- **Q3**: What were your expectations about AI and automation going into the event?
  - *Prompts*: Anticipated strengths/weaknesses of AI; concerns about fairness; expectations after the pre-game training.

## Section B — Preparation & Orientation (8 minutes)
- **Q4**: How did the pre-game orientation and materials (slides, reporting template, task bundle) shape your plan of attack?
  - *Prompts*: Most useful elements; gaps that remained; suggestions for improving the training.
- **Q5**: Did the assignment (inside vs. outside your primary discipline) influence how you prepared?
  - *Prompts*: Additional readings, reaching out to peers, focusing on certain sections of the replication package.

## Section C — Event Execution (Common to Both Arms) (12 minutes)
- **Q6**: Walk us through the key steps you took during the seven-hour window. When did things go smoothly, and when did they get tough?
  - *Prompts*: Data access, code execution, documentation, referee log.
- **Q7**: How did you manage your time and decide what to prioritize when obstacles appeared?
  - *Prompts*: Checkpoints, switching tasks, seeking assistance from proctors, taking breaks.

## Section D — Working With AI (AI-Assisted Sessions Only) (10 minutes)
- **Q8**: In what parts of your workflow did ChatGPT Plus make the biggest difference?
  - *Prompts*: Literature synthesis, code debugging, writing README/referee report, translating unfamiliar methods.
- **Q9**: How did you decide when to rely on AI versus manual work? Were there prompts or strategies that worked especially well—or poorly?
  - *Prompts*: Guardrails, verification steps, iterating on prompts, using Advanced Data Analysis vs. base chat.
- **Q10**: Did AI change how confident you felt about working outside your discipline (if applicable)?
  - *Prompts*: Clarifying jargon, adapting code, sanity-checking results.

## Section E — Working Without AI (Human-Only Sessions Only) (10 minutes)
- **Q8-control**: What strategies did you lean on in the absence of AI tools?
  - *Prompts*: Existing scripts, manuals, peer resources, longer debugging routes.
- **Q9-control**: How fair did the setup feel compared with teams who had AI access? What would have helped level the playing field?
  - *Prompts*: Additional documentation, reference prompts for manual replication, alternative tools.
- **Q10-control**: If you had access to an AI assistant, where do you think it would have helped the most—or least?
  - *Prompts*: Specific tasks, time savings, potential risks.

## Section F — Cross-Discipline Reflections (6 minutes)
- **Q11**: For those who worked outside their primary discipline, what were the biggest surprises or friction points?
  - *Prompts*: Terminology, statistical approaches, coding conventions, domain knowledge gaps.
- **Q12**: For those who worked inside their discipline, how did familiarity help—or hinder—your approach?
  - *Prompts*: Possible complacency, ability to spot errors, relevance of prior expertise.

## Section G — Outcomes, Feedback, and Future Directions (7 minutes)
- **Q13**: Looking back, what aspects of the Games most influenced your success (or lack thereof)?
  - *Prompts*: Training, AI access, task difficulty, reporting template.
- **Q14**: If you were designing the next wave, what would you keep, change, or add?
  - *Prompts*: Training improvements, AI guardrails, support mechanisms, team vs. individual format.
- **Q15**: How transferable do you think your experience is to your day-to-day research practice?
  - *Prompts*: Intentions to keep using AI (if treated), plans to share lessons with colleagues, concerns about adoption.

## Wrap-Up (2 minutes)
- Invite final comments: “Is there anything we didn’t ask that you think matters?”
- Thank participants, remind them about confidentiality, and share the timeline for when a short summary of findings will be circulated.

## Post-Session Checklist for Moderators
1. Save audio files using the format `FG##_ARM_DISCIPLINE_DATE.wav`.
2. Upload recordings to the encrypted I4R drive and notify the qualitative analysis lead.
3. Complete the moderator debrief form (key themes, notable quotes, follow-up questions) within 24 hours.
4. Flag any immediate protocol changes that should be considered before the next wave.
